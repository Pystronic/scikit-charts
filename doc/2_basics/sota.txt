Scikit-Learn provides few inherent visualization capabilities [a]. 
New plots require the use of matplotlib [b] or other plotting libraries.

The scikit-plot project provides additional plotting capabilities to Scikit.
It is hosted on GitHub [c] under the MIT license. The project expands Scikit by adding plots for additional metrics.
However, it is no longer actively devloped. The last commit was added in 2018. Fixes for existing issues are no longer added
to the repository.

Weights & Biases [d] is a general plattform for ML development and offers support for Scikit. The provided plots [e] are similar 
to scikit-plot. A disadvantige is the requirement for a comercial plan for teams and enterprises. However, additional
functionalities like model versioning are provided in return.
