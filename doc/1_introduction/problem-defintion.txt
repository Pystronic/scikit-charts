Diagrams are used to interpret regression model results.
Therefore being integral to many math libraries. However, the implementation is often not ideal.
The provided api is use-case specific. The resulting diagrams are static and do not allow interaction. 
This makes data exploration cumbersome.
The preferable solution is a generic dashboard for models. It should be both flexible to use in the code,
and provide powerful user interaction.
