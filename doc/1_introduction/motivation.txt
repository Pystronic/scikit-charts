Regression analysis is a great way to interfere, analyse and describe variables from data.
Therefore, competing with modern machine learning methods, like neural networks and generative algorithms.
However, more explainable results and cheaper training make it stand out among the rest.
Further supporting regression is an abundance of open source python libraries.
Libraries like scikit-learn; offering classes and algorithms, free of charge.
This makes regression a great tool for developers and data analysts.
